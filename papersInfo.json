We outline our methods for recovering both stellar and emission line components from the optical integral field spectroscopy, highlighting the developments and changes implemented to address specific challenges of the data set. The observations from the LVM project are unique because they cover a wide range of physical resolutions, from approximately 0.05 pc to 100 pc, depending on the distance to the targets. This, along with the varying number of stars sampled in each aperture (ranging from zero, just one of a few, to thousands), presents challenges in using previous spectral synthesis methods and interpreting the spectral fits. We provide a detailed explanation of how we model the stellar content and separate it from the ionized gas emission lines. To assess the accuracy of our results, we compare them with both idealized and more realistic simulations, highlighting the limitations of our methods. We find that the DAP robustly correct for stellar continuum features and recover emission line parameters (e.g. flux, equivalent width, systemtic velocity and velocity dispersion) with a precision and accuracy that fulfill the requirements of the primary goal of the analysis. In addition, the recovered stellar parameters are reliable for single stars, the recovery of integrated populations is less precise. We conclude with a description of the data products we provide, instructions for downloading and using our software, and a showcase illustrating the quality of the data and the analysis on a deep exposure taken on the Huygens region at the center of the Orion Nebula.\n        "}, {"ID": "2411.09733", "title": "Title:\n          Fuzzy Gasoline: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxy formation with Fuzzy Dark Matter\n        ", "authors": ["Matteo Nori", " Shubhan Bhatia", " Andrea V.

Using thirty zoom-in simulations of galaxies with halo masses in the range $10^9 \\lesssim M_{\\text{halo}}/M_{\\odot} \\lesssim 10^{11}$, we explore how the interplay between FDM quantum potential and baryonic processes influences dark matter distributions and observable galaxy properties. Our findings indicate that both baryons and low-mass FDM contribute to core formation within dark matter profiles, though through distinct mechanisms: FDM-induced cores emerge in all haloes, particularly within low-mass systems at high redshift, while baryon-driven cores form within a specific mass range and at low redshift. Despite these significant differences in dark matter structure, key stellar observables such as star formation histories and velocity dispersion profiles remain remarkably similar to predictions from the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, making it challenging to distinguish between CDM and FDM solely through stellar observations.\n        "}, {"ID": "2411.09735", "title": "Title:\n          Gas thermodynamics meets galaxy kinematics: Joint mass measurements for eROSITA galaxy clusters\n        ", "authors": ["Pengfei Li", " Ang Liu", " Matthias Kluge", " Johan Comparat", " Yong Tian", " Mariana P.

We select 22 galaxy clusters from the cluster catalog in the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) that have sufficient optical and near-infrared observations. We generate multi-band images in the energy range of (0.3, 7) keV for each cluster, and derive their temperature profiles, gas mass profiles and hydrostatic mass profiles using a parametric approach that does not assume dark matter halo models. With spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies collected from multiple surveys, we numerically solve the spherical Jeans equation for their dynamical mass profiles. Our results quantify the correlation between dynamical mass and line-of-sight velocity dispersion with an rms scatter of 0.14 dex. We find the two mass proxies lead to roughly the same total mass, with no observed systematic bias. As such, the $\\sigma_8$ tension is not specific to hydrostatic mass or weak lensing shears, but also appears with galaxy kinematics. We also compare our hydrostatic masses with the latest weak lensing masses inferred with scaling relations. The comparison shows the weak lensing mass is significantly higher than our hydrostatic mass by $\\sim$110%. This might explain the significantly larger value of $\\sigma_8$ from the latest measurement using eRASS1 clusters than almost all previous estimates in the literature. Finally, we test the radial acceleration relation (RAR) established in disk galaxies.

SNe Ia are also the main producers of iron and hence play a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. While recent observations have confirmed the basic theoretical picture of an exploding C-O WD star whose luminosity is powered by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, a number of uncertainties remain concerning the nature of the binary companion and the explosion mechanism.

For tidally coupled dipole pressure modes, the tidal coupling dominates over the Coriolis force and the resulting pulsations are ``triaxial\", with each of the three modes in a multiplet ``tidally tilted\" to be aligned with the one of the three principal axes of the star. The observed amplitudes and phases of the dipole modes aligned orthogonal to the spin axis are modulated throughout the orbit, producing doublets in the power spectrum that are spaced by exactly twice the orbital frequency. Quadrupole modes have similar but slightly more complex behavior. This amplitude modulation allows for mode identification which can potentially enable detailed asteroseismic analyses of tidally tilted pulsators. Pressure modes should exhibit this behavior in stellar binaries close enough to be tidally synchronized, while gravity modes should remain aligned with the star's spin axis.

On the premise of fitting the X-ray intensity and photon index profiles, we find that the magnetic field within the Boomerang nebula is weak ($\\sim 10\\mu$G in the core region and diminishing to $1\\mu\\,G$ at the periphery), which therefore implies a significant contribution to the UHE gamma-ray emission by the inverse Compton (IC) radiation of injected electron/positron pairs. Depending on the particle transport mechanism, the UHE gamma-ray flux contributed by the Boomerang nebula via the IC radiation may constitute about $10-50\\%$ of the flux of LHAASO~J2226+6057 at 100\\,TeV, and up to 30\\% at 500\\,TeV. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and discuss potential hadronic UHE emission from the PWN. In our modeling, most of the spindown luminosity of the pulsar may be transformed into thermal particles or relativistic protons.\n        "}, {"ID": "2411.09902", "title": "Title:\n          Investigation of the non-thermal X-ray emission from the supernova remnant CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7$-$381031\n        ", "authors": ["Chanho Kim (1)", " Jaegeun Park (1)", " Hongjun An (1)", " Kaya Mori (2)", " Stephen P.

Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is a plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However, recent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust grains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution models that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more strongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously anticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that enables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly drifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly drifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the timescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial advection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for the transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion structure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and radial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations confirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when the predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by MHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal formation from poorly sticky grains.\n        "}, {"ID": "2411.09940", "title": "Title:\n          Modeling protoplanetary disk heating by planet-induced spiral shocks\n        ", "authors": ["Tomohiro Ono", " Tatsuki Okamura", " Satoshi Okuzumi", " Takayuki Muto"], "subject": "Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)", "abstract": "\n          We investigate the heating of protoplanetary disks caused by shocks associated with spiral density waves induced by an embedded planet.

Under linear ideal pressureless MHD, we examine two-dimensional (2D) axial fundamental kink motions that arise when localized velocity exciters impact some symmetric slab equilibria. Continuous structuring is allowed for. A 1D initial value problem (IVP) is formulated in conjunction with an eigenvalue problem (EVP) for laterally open systems, with no strict boundary conditions (BCs) at infinity. The IVP is solved by eigenfunction expansion, allowing a clear distinction between the contributions from proper eigenmodes and improper continuum eigenmodes. Example solutions are offered for parameters typical of active region loops. Our solutions show that the system evolves towards long periodicities due to proper eigenmodes (of order the axial Alfven time), whereas the interference of the improper continuum may lead to short periodicities initially (of order the lateral Alfven time). Specializing to the slab axis, we demonstrate that the proper contribution strengthens with the density contrast, but may occasionally be stronger for less steep density profiles. Short periodicities are not guaranteed in the improper contribution, the details of the initial exciter being key. When identifiable, these periodicities tend to agree with the oscillation frequencies expected for DLMs, despite the differences in the BCs between our EVP and classic analyses. The eigenfunction expansion approach enables all qualitative features to be interpreted as the interplay between the initial exciter and some response function, the latter solely determined by the equilibria.

The limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of coronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower corona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been performed until now. Here we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of local and global heating rates it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE condition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass and energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of foot-point heating that can be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help to explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of highly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of this finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including plumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal holes and the slow solar wind (SSW) that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.\n        "}, {"ID": "2411.10223", "title": "Title:\n          Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays versus Models of High Energy Hadronic Interactions\n        ", "authors": ["Bla\u017e Bortolato", " Jernej F.

In this work, we report the discovery that while weakly magnetic white dwarfs of all ages with M < 1Mo show polarimetric variability with a period between hours and several days, the large majority of magnetic white dwarfs in the same mass range with cooling ages older than 2 Gyr and field strengths > 10 MG show little or no polarimetric variability. This could be interpreted as extremely slow rotation, but a lack of known white dwarfs with measured periods longer than two weeks means that we do not see white dwarfs slowing their rotation. We therefore suggest a different interpretation: old strongly magnetic white dwarfs do not vary because their fields are roughly symmetric about the rotation axes. Symmetry may either be a consequence of field evolution or a physical characteristic intrinsic to the way strong fields are generated in older stars. Specifically, a strong magnetic field could distort the shape of a star, forcing the principal axis of maximum inertia away from the spin axis. Eventually, as a result of energy dissipation, the magnetic axis will align with the angular momentum axis. We also find that the higher-mass strongly magnetised white dwarfs, which are likely the products of the merging of two white dwarfs, may appear as either polarimetrically variable or constant. This may be the symptom of two different formation channels or the consequence of the fact that a dynamo operating during a merger may produce diverse magnetic configurations. Alternatively, the massive white dwarfs with constant polarisation may be rotating with periods much shorter than the typical exposure times of the observations.\n        "}, {"ID": "2411.10286", "title": "Title:\n          Tracing 3-D Magnetic Field Structure Using Dust Polarization and the Zeeman Effect\n        ", "authors": ["Brandon Shane", " Blakesley Burkhart", " Laura Fissel", " Susan E.

By analyzing a suite of AREPO simulations, this paper investigates how observables can relate to underlying physical properties to derive a more comprehensive picture of the magnetic field's inclination angle and strength, specifically in regions where both dust polarization and Zeeman data are available.

This is consistent with previous studies relating this transition with an increase in mass-loss rate, dust formation, and the appearance of long secondary periods. The luminosity and effective temperature at the onset of pulsation are found to depend on metallicity, hydrogen content, and the adopted mixing length parameter. This confirms the role of partial hydrogen ionization in driving the pulsation, supporting the idea of a heat mechanism similar to that of classical pulsators. We examine the impact of turbulent viscosity, and find clear evidence that it must be adjusted according to the stellar chemical and physical parameters to fully match observations. In order to improve the predictive power of pulsation models, the turbulent viscosity and the temperature scale of pulsating red giants must be jointly calibrated.

We used the resonant angle instead of the frequency ratio, which allowed us to clearly distinguish between these two processes in numerical simulations. We show that trapping and heating occur simultaneously, at least at the stage of a mature bar, that is, some orbits quickly pass through vertical resonance while at the same time, a substantial number of orbits remains trapped into this stage for a long time. Half of all bar orbits spend more than 2.5 Gyr in vertical resonance over an interval of 4 Gyr.

This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO.

The observed DM contains the contributions from the Milky Way (MW), the MW halo, IGM, and the host galaxy. Unfortunately, IGM and the host galaxy of FRB are poorly known to date, and hence the large uncertainties of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\\rm DM_{host}$ in DM plague the FRB cosmology.

From the lessons of calibrating type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as standard candles, we consider a universal subclassification scheme for FRBs, and there are some empirical relations for them. In the present work, we propose to calibrate type Ib FRBs as standard candles by using a tight empirical relation without DM. The calibrated type Ib FRBs at high redshifts can be used like SNIa to constrain the cosmological models. We also test the key factors affecting the calibration and the cosmological constraints. Notice that the results are speculative, since they are based on simulations for the future (instead of now).

The ICL and ICGCs share a coherent spatial distribution, suggesting a common origin or that a common potential governs their distribution. Their contours on the largest scales (>200 kpc) are offset from the BCG's core westwards by 60 kpc towards several luminous cluster galaxies. This offset is opposite to the displacement observed in the gaseous intracluster medium. The radial surface brightness profile of the BCG+ICL is best described by a double S\u00e9rsic model, with 68$\\pm$4% of the H$_E$ light in the extended, outer component. The transition between these components occurs at ~60 kpc, beyond which the isophotes become increasingly elliptical and off-centred. The radial ICGC number density profile closely follows the BCG+ICL profile only beyond this 60 kpc radius, where we find an average of 60-80 GCs per $10^9$ M$_\\odot$ of diffuse stellar mass. The BCG+ICL colour becomes increasingly blue with radius, consistent with the stellar populations in the ICL having subsolar metallicities [Fe/H] ~ -0.6 to -1.0. The colour of the ICL, and the specific frequency and luminosity function of the ICGCs suggest that the ICL+ICGCs were tidally stripped from the outskirts of massive satellites with masses of a few $\\times10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$, with an increasing contribution from dwarf galaxies at large radii.\n        "}, {"ID": "2406.00155", "title": "Title:\n          Lessons from the high-resolution spectroscopy of AW UMa and Epsilon CrA: Is the Lucy model valid?\n        ", "authors": ["Slavek M.

The detection of the very faint profile of the secondary component in AW UMa leads to a new spectroscopic determination of the mass ratio, q(sp) = 0.092 +/- 0.007, which is close to the previous, medium-resolution spectroscopic result of Pribulla & Rucinski (2008), q(sp) = 0.101 +/- 0.006, and remains substantially different from a cluster of generally accepted photometric results by several authors, concentrated around q(ph) = 0.080 +/- 0.005. The two approaches are independent, with the spectroscopic technique being more direct yet more demanding on telescope/spectrograph resources, while the photometric determinations are accessible to smaller telescopes but entirely dependent on the Lucy model. A survey of binaries with the best-determined values of the mass ratio shows a common tendency for q(ph) < q(sp). The tendency for systematically smaller values of q(ph) may result from the overfilling of the primary lobe and underfilling of the secondary lobe relative to the Roche model geometry, as predicted by the Stepien (2009) model; the tendency may be variable in time. Despite the observed moderate inter-systemic velocities, the photometric Lucy model may remain useful in providing approximate, though biased, results for the mass ratio. A complicating factor in detailed spectral analysis may be the occurrence of Enhanced Spectral-line Perturbations (ESP) projected over the secondary profiles, appearing in different numbers in the two studied binaries. The ESPs are tentatively identified within the Stepien model as collision fronts or fountains of hot, primary-component gas from the circumbinary, energy-carrying flow.\n        "}, {"ID": "2406.02531", "title": "Title:\n          Hybrid inflation and gravitational waves from accidentally light scalars\n        ", "authors": ["Felix Br\u00fcmmer", " Giacomo Ferrante", " Michele Frigerio"], "subject": "Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)", "abstract": "\n          We construct a hybrid-inflation model where the inflaton potential is generated radiatively, as gauge symmetries guarantee it to be accidentally flat at tree level.

We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w<-1$ at early times, that is challenging to realize in consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state of dark energy around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CPL at early times, possibly with $w>-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CPL at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times.

We resolve several absorption and emission lines including a strong line pair near the N VII rest-frame energy, resembling the P-Cygni profile.

The column density and ionization are comparable to the outflows detected in some tidal disruption events, but this outflow is significantly faster and has a strong emission component. The outflow is more highly ionized when the system is in the phase during which QPEs are present, and from the limits we derive on its location, we conclude that the outflow is connected to the recent complex, transient activity of GSN 069 which began around 2010.\n        "}, {"ID": "2407.02879", "title": "Title:\n          Analysis of the Emission and Morphology of the Pulsar Wind Nebula Candidate HAWC J2031+415\n        ", "authors": ["R.

This method can be computationally limited by the ability to compare proposal templates with the accepted templates in the bank. To alleviate this computational load, we introduce the use of inner product inequalities to reduce the number of required comparisons.

However, due to the rarity of protoclusters (and thus the large simulation volume required) and the complexity of modeling dust emission from galaxies, the relationship between SMGs and protoclusters has not been adequately addressed in the theoretical literature. In this work, we apply the L-GALAXIES semi-analytic model (SAM) to the Millennium N-body simulation. We assign submillimetre (submm) flux densities to the model galaxies using a scaling relation from previous work, in which dust radiative transfer was performed on high-resolution galaxy zoom simulations. We find that the fraction of model galaxies that are submm-bright is higher in protocluster cores than in both protocluster `outskirts' and the field; the fractions for the latter two are similar. This excess is not driven by an enhanced starburst frequency. Instead, the primary reason is that overdense environments have a relative overdensity of high-mass halos and thus `oversample' the high-mass end of the star formation main sequence relative to less-dense environments. The fraction of SMGs that are optically bright is dependent on stellar mass and redshift but independent of environment. The fraction of galaxies for which the majority of star formation is dust-obscured is higher in protocluster cores, primarily due to the dust-obscured fraction being correlated with stellar mass.

We investigate the effect of changing the parameters of the scanning strategy on the in-flight calibration effectiveness, the suppression of the systematic effects themselves, and the ability to distinguish systematic effects by null-tests. Next-generation missions such as LiteBIRD, modulated by a Half-Wave Plate (HWP), will be able to observe polarisation using a single detector, eliminating the need to combine several detectors to measure polarisation, as done in many previous experiments and hence avoiding the consequent systematic effects. While the HWP is expected to suppress many systematic effects, some of them will remain. We use an analytical approach to comprehensively address the mitigation of these systematic effects and identify the characteristics of scanning strategies that are the most effective for implementing a variety of calibration strategies in the multi-dimensional space of common spacecraft scan parameters.

We call it {\\it quintessential early dark energy} model in which early and late dark energy are explained by a single scalar field. In other words two different energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To achieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential. This potential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat region followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial role in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential can almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time acceleration. But, at the perturbation level the potential shows significant difference with the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential, modified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the available background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024), supernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements. Even after the presence of required EDE solution in all four potentials we don't get any significant improvement in the value of $H_0$. The maximum improvement we get in the present value of Hubble parameter compared to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model is for the axionlike potential.

The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological tensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain hardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy (DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made out of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should stress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces positive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name).

Such precision is similar to what is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in $\\sim$ 2030) for single stars fainter than G = 13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as SU Cyg. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in accurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for the expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core overshooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed us to compare prediction period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement of 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations calibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement.\n        "}, {"ID": "2411.07281", "title": "Title:\n          The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall\n        ", "authors": ["F.

This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.\n        "}, {"ID": "2411.08170", "title": "Title:\n          Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by $\\Delta$E-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector\n        ", "authors": ["Daniel Reichart", " Nickolas Solomey"], "subject": "Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)", "abstract": "\n          The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\\nu$SOL).
